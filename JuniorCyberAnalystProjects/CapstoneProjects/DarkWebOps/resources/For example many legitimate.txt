For example many legitimate websites operate on the TOR network to allow access to their platforms for users in countries that have strong censorship:

Facebook ( Social Media ) https://www.facebookwkhpilnemxj7asaniu7vnjjbiltxjqhye3mhbshg7kx5tfyd.onion/
DuckDuckGo ( Search Engine ) https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/
The New York Times ( News ) https://www.nytimesn7cgmftshazwhfgzm37qxb44r64ytbb2dj3x62d2lljsciiyd.onion/
BBC ( News ) https://www.bbcnewsd73hkzno2ini43t4gblxvycyac5aw4gnv7t2rccijh7745uqd.onion/
ProtonMail ( Email ) https://protonmailrmez3lotccipshtkleegetolb73fuirgj7r4o4vfu7ozyd.onion/




Below is a list of the sites that you need to find either using clear web or dark web search engines to find their current URLs, and then answer an additional question by visiting them using the TOR browser.
