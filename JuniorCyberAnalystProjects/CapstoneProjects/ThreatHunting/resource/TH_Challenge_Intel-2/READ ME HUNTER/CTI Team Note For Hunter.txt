Hey Hunter, Matt from the Threat Intel Team here. Got a few things that might help you.

> The two samples are in the folder "CTI Team - Malware Samples" on the Desktop. Grab your
IOCs from them.

> It goes without saying, but don't open the malware. Why? Because it's malware.

> We've saved you some work and identified the following strings that are present in
the samples, use them as IOCs (but make sure Redline is accepting Strings, see the
brief to enable them); 390808010001Z0U1 , #H3XGROUPWASHERE

> We believe the User "DaveS" has potentially downloaded both samples, so limit Redline
to only search directories associated with this user, otherwise you'll miss your lunch
break ;)

> Good luck! Sorry to put this on you, we're just so busy today.
